## Designcraft for experiments open data   
A set of remote exercises exploring experimental design for the life sciences. A total of three independent labs were done to focus on different design principles, sampling techniques, and taxa. Exercises are described in full in this open access manual entitled [Designcraft for experiments](https://bookdown.org/chris/designcraft4experiments/). Data were collected by students in a third-year biology course offering at [York University](https://biology.yorku.ca) in Toronto, ON, Canada. Students collected the data and published individual datasets to [figshare](https://figshare.com) with a [CCBY4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licensing. Data were then compiled for each lab including balcony birdwatching, backyard bioblitz, and solo surveys by M. Zuliani and M. Owen. The provenance of each independent observation in the compiled data was recognized by attribution to the initials of the primary data author.  

Attribution  
CJL designed the experiments.  
Students in course offering collected, innovated, and published individual, primary datasets.  
MZ, MO, and CJL reviewed the compiled data.
